abstract: In this talk, I will report on our previous work (Abel and Stemle 2018)
  and will relate it to our current work that is conducted as part of our institution's
  observer status in the European Lexicographic Infrastructure (ELEXIS) project (Simon
  Krek et al. 2018). ELEXIS features the *One-Click Dictionary* tool chain to automatically
  generate, for example, headword lists, word (and other lexical unit) senses, definitions,
  and corpus based examples. The tool chain consists of the corpus query system Sketch
  Engine (Kilgarriff et al. 2014) and the dictionary writing system Lexonomy (Měchura
  2017); together they are supposed to support lexicographers along the entire pipeline
  of producing a dictionary, from corpus to screen, where dictionaries are pre-generated
  automatically from a corpus (using the Sketch Engine) and then post-edited (using
  Lexonomy).
