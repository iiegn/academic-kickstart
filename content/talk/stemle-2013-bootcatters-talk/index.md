abstract: "\"Copyright issues remain a gray area in compiling and distributing Web\
  \ corpora\"(Fletcher online); and even though \"If a Web corpus is infringing copyright,\
  \ then it is merely doing on a small scale what search engines such as Google are\
  \ doing on a colossal scale\"(Kilgarriff and Grefenstette 2003), and \"If you want\
  \ your webpage to be removed from our corpora, please contact us\"(WaCKy Project\
  \ online), are practical stances the former, given the increased heat Google&Co.\
  \ are facing on this matter, might be of limited use, and the latter still entails\
  \ some legal risk. Also, \"Even if the concrete legal threats are probably minor,\
  \ they may have negative impact on fund-raising\"(Lüdeling, Evert and Baroni 2007).\
  \ So, (adding the possibility for) minimizing the legal risks, or rather, actively\
  \ facing and eliminating them is paramount to the WaCky initiative. Theoretical\
  \ aspects of creating 'a free' corpus are covered in Brunello (2009); one result\
  \ is that 'the Creative Commons (CC) licenses' are the most promising legal model\
  \ to use as a filter for web pages. Also, examples of 'free' (CC) corpora already\
  \ exist, cf. \"The English CC corpus by The Centre for Translation Studies, University\
  \ of Leeds\" and \"The Paisà corpus by University of Bologna (Lead Partner)). On\
  \ a technical level, the change from Google/Yahoo! to Bing as a search API for BootCaT\
  \ complicated things: Google and Yahoo! both allow for filtering search results\
  \ according to a - perceived - CC license of a page (for Yahoo! this filter was\
  \ part of BootCaT and was used in 'the Paisà corpus'); unfortunately, Bing does\
  \ not support this option. Then, the \"Best Practices for Marking Content with CC\
  \ Licenses\"(Creative Commons online) should be used as clues to filter downloaded\
  \ content - and given the nature of the BootCaT pipeline, i.e. the downloaded pages\
  \ are stripped early on (e.g. meta data from html pages; CC info in boilerplate,\
  \ etc.), post-processing of the pages is not promising. The filter option could\
  \ be integrated along the other \"various filters\", e.g. 'bad word thresholds',\
  \ in retrieve_and_clean_pages_from_url_list.pl because there the whole page, with\
  \ meta data and boilerplate, is available (for the first and the last time)."
