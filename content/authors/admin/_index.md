I am Cognitive Scientist: I study skills like perception, thinking, learning,
motor function, and language by combining the humanistic and analytical
methods of the arts and the formal sciences.

My research focus lies in the area where Computational Linguistics and
Artificial Intelligence converge. I work on computer aided fabrication of
ontologies from large document repositories, the technological feasibility
thereof and the utilization of cross-linked structured data in applications, as
well as on tools for editing, processing, and annotating linguistic data.

My curiosity in research is driven by the question why humans handle incomplete
and – more often than not – inconsistent structured concepts just fine, whereas
computational processes are often of little avail or fail completely.
