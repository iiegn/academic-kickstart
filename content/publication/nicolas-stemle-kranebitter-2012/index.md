abstract: We report on on-going work to derive translations of phrases from parallel
  corpora. We describe an unsupervised and knowledge-free greedy-style process relying
  on innovative strategies for choosing and discarding candidate translations. This
  process manages to acquire multiple translations combining phrases of equal or different
  sizes. The preliminary evaluation performed confirms both its potential and its
  interest.
