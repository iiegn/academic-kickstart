abstract: This article describes the system that participated in the Part-of-speech
  tagging subtask of the "EmpiriST 2015 shared task on automatic linguistic annotation
  of computer-mediated communication / social media". The system combines a small
  assertion of trending techniques, which implement matured methods, from NLP and
  ML to achieve competitive results on PoS tagging of German CMC and Web corpus data;
  in particular, the system uses word embeddings and character-level representations
  of word beginnings and endings in a LSTM RNN architecture. Labelled data (Tiger
  v2.2 and EmpiriST) and unlabelled data (German Wikipedia) were used for training.
  The system is available under the APLv2 open-source license.
