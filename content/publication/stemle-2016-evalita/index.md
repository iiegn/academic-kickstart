abstract: This article describes the system that participated in the POS tagging for
  Italian Social Media Texts (PoSTWITA) task of the 5th periodic evaluation campaign
  of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and speech tools for the Italian language EVALITA
  2016. The work is a continuation of Stemle (2016) with minor modifications to the
  system and different data sets. It combines a small assertion of trending techniques,
  which implement matured methods, from NLP and ML to achieve competitive results
  on PoS tagging of Italian Twitter texts; in particular, the system uses word embeddings
  and character-level representations of word beginnings and endings in a LSTM RNN
  architecture. Labelled data (Italian UD corpus, DiDi and PoSTWITA) and unlabbelled
  data (Italian C4Corpus and PAISA') were used for training. The system is available
  under the APLv2 open-source license.
