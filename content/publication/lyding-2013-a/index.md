abstract: In this article, we present the multi-faceted interface to the open PAISÀ
  corpus of Italian. Created within the project PAISÀ (Piattaforma per l’Apprendimento
  dell’Italiano Su corpora Annotati) [1], the corpus is designed to be freely available
  for non-commercial processing, usage and distribution by the public. Hence, this
  automatically annotated corpus (for lemma, part-of-speech and dependency information)
  is exclusively composed of documents licensed under Creative Commons (CC) licenses
  [2].The dedicated corpus interface is designed to provide flexible, powerful, and
  easy-to-use modes of corpus access, with the objective to support language learning,
  language practicing and linguistic analyses. We present in detail the interface’s
  functionalities and discuss the underlying design decisions. We introduce the four
  principal components of the interface, describe supported display formats and present
  two specific features added to increase the interface's relevance for language learning.
  The main search components are (1) a basic search that adopts a "Google-style" search
  box, (2) an advanced search that provides elaborated graphical search options, and
  (3) a search that makes use of the powerful CQP query language of the Open Corpus
  Workbench [3]. In addition, (4) a filter interface for retrieving full-text corpus
  documents based on keyword searches is available. It is likewise providing the means
  for building temporary sub-corpora for specific topics. Users can choose among different
  display formats for the search results. Besides the established KWIC (KeyWord In
  Context) and full sentence views, graphical representations of the dependency relation
  information as well as keyword distributions are available. These dynamic displays
  are based on a visualisation for dependency graphs [4] and one for Word Clouds [5],
  which build on latest developments in information visualisation for language data.
  Two special features for novice learners are integrated into each search component.
  The first feature is a function for restricting search results to sentences of limited
  complexity. Search results are automatically filtered based on formal text characteristics
  such as sentence length, vocabulary, etc. The second is the supply of pre-defined
  search queries for linguistic constructions such as sentences in passive voice,
  questions, etc. Finally, we show how the PAISÀ interface can be employed in different
  language teaching tasks. In particular, we present a complete unit of work aimed
  at learners of Italian (CEFR level A2/B1) and centered on students’ direct use of
  the interface and its functionalities. By doing so, we are giving concrete examples
  for targeted searches and interactions with the provided language material, as well
  as an exemplification of how the use of the corpus can be integrated with communicative
  language activities in the classroom.
