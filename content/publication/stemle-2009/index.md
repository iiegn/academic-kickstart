abstract: This thesis discusses the KrdWrd Project. The Project goals are to provide
  tools and infrastructure for acquisition, visual annotation, merging and storage
  of Web pages as parts of bigger corpora, and to develop a classification engine
  that learns to automatically annotate pages, operate on the visual rendering of
  pages, and provide visual tools for inspection of results.
