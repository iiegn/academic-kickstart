abstract: Developing content extraction methods for Humanities domains raises a number
  of chal- lenges, from the abundance of non-standard entity types to their complexity
  to the scarcity of data. Close collaboration with Humani- ties scholars is essential
  to address these chal- lenges. We discuss an annotation schema for Archaeological
  texts developed in collabora- tion with domain experts. Its development re- quired
  a number of iterations to make sure all the most important entity types were included,
  as well as addressing challenges including a domain-specific handling of temporal
  expres- sions, and the existence of many systematic types of ambiguity.
