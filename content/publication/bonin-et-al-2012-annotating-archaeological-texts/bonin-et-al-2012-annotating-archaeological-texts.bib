 abstract = {Developing content extraction methods for Humanities domains raises a number of chal- lenges, from the abundance of non-standard entity types to their complexity to the scarcity of data. Close collaboration with Humani- ties scholars is essential to address these chal- lenges. We discuss an annotation schema for Archaeological texts developed in collabora- tion with domain experts. Its development re- quired a number of iterations to make sure all the most important entity types were included, as well as addressing challenges including a domain-specific handling of temporal expres- sions, and the existence of many systematic types of ambiguity.},
