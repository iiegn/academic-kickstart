abstract: In this article, we examine the current situation of data dissemination
  and provision for CMC corpora. By that we aim to give a guiding grid for future
  projects that will improve the transparency and replicability of research results
  as well as the reusability of the created resources. Based on the FAIR guiding principles
  for research data management, we evaluate the 20 European CMC corpora listed in
  the CLARIN CMC Resource family, individuate successful strategies among the existing
  corpora and establish best practices for future projects. We give an overview of
  existing approaches to data referencing, dissemination and provision in European
  CMC corpora, and discuss the methods, formats and strategies used. Furthermore,
  we discuss the need for community standards and offer recommendations for best practices
  when creating a new CMC corpus.
