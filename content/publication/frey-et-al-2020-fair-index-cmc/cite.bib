 abstract = {In this article, we examine the current situation of data dissemination and provision for CMC corpora. By that we aim to give a guiding grid for future projects that will improve the transparency and replicability of research results as well as the reusability of the created resources. Based on the FAIR guiding principles for research data management, we evaluate the 20 European CMC corpora listed in the CLARIN CMC Resource family, individuate successful strategies among the existing corpora and establish best practices for future projects. We give an overview of existing approaches to data referencing, dissemination and provision in European CMC corpora, and discuss the methods, formats and strategies used. Furthermore, we discuss the need for community standards and offer recommendations for best practices when creating a new CMC corpus.},
