abstract: This paper is describing the needs and technological preconditions of the
  CLARIN ERIC infrastructure. It introduces how containerization using Docker can
  help to meet these requirements and fleshes out the build and deployment workflow
  that CLARIN ERIC is employing to ensure that all the goals of their infrastructure
  are met in an efficient and sustainable way. In a second step, it is also shown
  how these same workflows can help researchers, especially in the fields of computational
  and corpus linguistics, to provide for more easily reproducible research by creating
  a virtual environment that can provide specific versions of data, programs and algorithms
  used for certain research questions and make sure that the exact same versions can
  still be used at a later stage to reproduce the results.
