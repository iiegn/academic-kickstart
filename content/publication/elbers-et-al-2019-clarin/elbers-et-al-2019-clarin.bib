 abstract = {This paper is describing the needs and technological preconditions of the CLARIN ERIC infrastructure. It introduces how containerization using Docker can help to meet these requirements and fleshes out the build and deployment workflow that CLARIN ERIC is employing to ensure that all the goals of their infrastructure are met in an efficient and sustainable way. In a second step, it is also shown how these same workflows can help researchers, especially in the fields of computational and corpus linguistics, to provide for more easily reproducible research by creating a virtual environment that can provide specific versions of data, programs and algorithms used for certain research questions and make sure that the exact same versions can still be used at a later stage to reproduce the results.},
