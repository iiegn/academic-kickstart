abstract: In this paper, we present ongoing experiments for correcting OCR errors
  on German newspapers in Fraktur font. Our approach borrows from techniques for spelling
  correction in context using a probabilistic edit-operation error model and lexical
  resources. We highlight conditions in which high error reduction rates can be obtained
  and where the approach currently stands with real data.
