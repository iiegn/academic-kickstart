abstract: "In this paper, we present ongoing experiments for correcting OCR errors on German newspapers in Fraktur font. Our approach borrows from techniques for spelling correction in context using a probabilistic edit-operation error model and lexical resources. We highlight conditions in which high error reduction rates can be obtained and where the approach currently stands with real data."
