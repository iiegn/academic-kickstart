abstract: 'In this paper, we propose an integrated web strategy for mixed sociolinguistic
  research methodologies in the context of social media corpora. After stating the
  particular challenges for building corpora of private, non-public computer-mediated
  communication, we will present our solution to these problems: a Facebook web application
  for the acquisition of such data and the corresponding meta data. Finally, we will
  discuss positive and negative implications for this method.'
