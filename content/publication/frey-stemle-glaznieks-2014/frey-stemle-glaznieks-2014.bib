 abstract = {In this paper, we propose an integrated web strategy for mixed sociolinguistic research methodologies in the context of social media corpora. After stating the particular challenges for building corpora of private, non-public computer-mediated communication, we will present our solution to these problems: a Facebook web application for the acquisition of such data and the corresponding meta data. Finally, we will discuss positive and negative implications for this method.},
