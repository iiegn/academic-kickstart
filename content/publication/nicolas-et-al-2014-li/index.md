abstract: We present an abstract and generic workflow, and detail how it has been
  implemented to build and annotate learner corpora. This workflow has been developed
  through an interdisciplinary collaboration between linguists, who annotate and use
  corpora, and computational linguists and computer scientists, who are responsible
  for providing technical support and adaptation or implementation of software components.
