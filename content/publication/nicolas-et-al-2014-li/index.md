abstract: "We present an abstract and generic workflow, and detail how it has been implemented to build and annotate learner corpora. This workflow has been developed through an interdisciplinary collaboration between linguists, who annotate and use corpora, and computational linguists and computer scientists, who are responsible for providing technical support and adaptation or implementation of software components."
