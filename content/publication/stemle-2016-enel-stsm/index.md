abstract: "ENeL's WG3 concerns innovative e-dictionaries with a focus on the development\
  \ of digitally born dictionaries. The training school 2016 in Ljubljana (SI), May\
  \ 17-20, introduced parti­cipants, among others, to collecting, analysing, and automatically\
  \ extracting data from web corpora. Albeit related, the task of processing data\
  \ from corpora of computer-mediated communica­tion and social media interactions\
  \ (henceforth referred to as CMC) has been deliberately ex­cluded from the training\
  \ school's programme. But we know that \"new vocabulary is charac­teristic for CMC\
  \ discourse, e.g. ‘funzen’ (an abbreviated variant of the German verb ‘funk­tionieren’,\
  \ en.: ‘to function’) or ‘gruscheln’ (verb denoting a function of a German social\
  \ net­work platform, most likely a blending of ‘grüßen’, en.: ‘to greet’ and ‘kuscheln’,\
  \ en.: ‘to cuddle’)\" and therefore relevant to WG3; the goal of this STSM is to\
  \ apply the meth­ods and tools from the training school to CMC data."
