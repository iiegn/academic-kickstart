 abstract = {In recent years, the reproducibility of scientific research has more and more come into focus, both from external stakeholders (e.g. funders) and from within research communities themselves. Corpus linguistics and its methods, which are an integral component of many other disciplines working with language data, play a special role here – language corpora are often living objects: they are constantly being improved and revised, and at the same time, the tools for the automatic processing of human language are also regularly updated, both of which can lead to different results for the same processing steps. This article argues that modern software technologies such as version control and containerization can address both issues, namely make reproducible the process of software packaging, installation, and execution and, more importantly, the tracking of corpora throughout their life cycle, thereby making the changes to the raw data reproducible for many subsequent analyses.},
