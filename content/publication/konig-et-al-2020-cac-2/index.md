abstract: 'In recent years, the reproducibility of scientific research has increasingly
  come into focus, both by ex ternal stakeholders (e.g. funders) and by the research
  communities themselves. Corpus linguistics, with its methods for creating, processing
  and analysing corpora, is an integral part of many other disciplines that work with
  language data and therefore plays a special role. Moreover, language corpora are
  often living objects that are regularly improved and revised. At the same time,
  tools for the automatic processing of human language are also being developed further,
  which can lead to different results with the same processing steps and the same
  data. This article argues that modern software technologies, such as version control
  and containerisation, can mitigate the following problems: Software packaging, installation
  and execution and, equally important, the tracking of corpus modifications throughout
  its life-cycle. All in all, this leads to transparency of changes to raw data and
  software tools and thereby enhanced reproducibility.'
