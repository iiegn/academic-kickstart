abstract: This paper describes the adaptation and application of a neural network
  system for the automatic detection of metaphors. The  LSTM BiRNN system participated
  in the shared task of metaphor identification that was part of the Second Workshop
  of Figurative Language Processing (FigLang2020) held at the Annual Conference of
  the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL2020). The particular focus of
  our approach is on the potential influence that the metadata given in the ETS Corpus
  of Non-Native Written English might have on the automatic detection of metaphors
  in this dataset. The article first discusses the annotated ETS learner data, highlighting
  some of its peculiarities and inherent biases of metaphor use. A series of evaluations
  follow in order to test whether specific metadata influence the system performance
  in the task of automatic metaphor identification. The system is available under
  the APLv2 open-source license.
