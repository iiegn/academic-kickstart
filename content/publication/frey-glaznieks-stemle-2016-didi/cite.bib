 abstract = {The DiDi corpus of South Tyrolean data of computer-mediated communication (CMC) is a multilingual sociolinguistic language corpus. It consists of around 600,000 tokens collected from 136 profiles of Facebook users residing in South Tyrol, Italy. In conformity with the multilingual situation of the territory, the main languages of the corpus are German and Italian (followed by English). The data has been manually anonymised and provides manually corrected part-of-speech tags for the Italian language texts and manually normalised data for German texts. Moreover, it is annotated with user-provided socio-demographic data (among others L1, gender, age, education, and internet communication habits) from a questionnaire, and linguistic annotations regarding CMC phenomena, languages and varieties. The anonymised corpus is freely available for research purposes.},
