abstract: In recent years, research data management has also become an important topic
  in the less data-intensive areas of the Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH). Funding
  agencies as well as research communities demand that empirical data collected and
  used for scientific research is managed and preserved in a way that research results
  are reproducible. In order to account for this the FAIR guiding principles for data
  stewardship have been established as a framework for good data management, aiming
  at the findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability of research
  data. This article investigates 24 European CMC corpora with regard to their compliance
  with the FAIR principles and discusses to what extent the deposit of research data
  in repositories of data preservation initiatives such as CLARIN, Zenodo or Metashare
  can assist in the provision of FAIR corpora.
