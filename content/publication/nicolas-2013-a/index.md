abstract: In this paper, we report on an unsupervised greedy-style process for acquiring
  phrase translations from sentence-aligned parallel corpora. Thanks to innovative
  selection strategies, this process can acquire multiple translations without size
  criteria, i.e. phrases can have several translations, can be of any size, and their
  size is not considered when selecting their translations. Even though the process
  is in an early development stage and has much room for improvements, evaluation
  shows that it yields phrase translations of high precision that are relevant to
  machine translation but also to a wider set of applications including memory-based
  translation or multi-word acquisition.
